## Hello World

I finally got around to buying derekbraid.com and putting a site up!  I have put up some links to my work and will slowly expand it.

Please send feedback to me on twitter [@Royal_Arse](http://twitter.com/Royal_Arse).

## Tech

Using react, via the amazing cli tool create-react-app, see [boilerplate readme](https://github.com/DeBraid/derekbraid.com/blob/master/CRA-README.md).

This site uses google anayltics via `react-ga` found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ga).  A cool npm package for tracking views and events on your site.
